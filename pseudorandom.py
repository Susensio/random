# A pseudorandom number genrator (PRNG), also known as a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG)
# is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers whose properties approximate he properties of sequences of random numbers.
# The PRNG-generated sequence is not truly random, because it is completely determined 
# by a relatively small set of initial values, called de PRNG's seeds (which may include truly random values).
# Make your own (pseudo) random number generator. Accept input from the user specifying the number of
# random numbers to generate and the PRNG seed. Output a list of pseudo-random numbers.
